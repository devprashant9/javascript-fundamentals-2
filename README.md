# javascript-fundamentals-2
This is the Part II of Javascript Fundamentals with some advanced concepts like Classes, Objects, Callbacks, etc. It is advised to complete Part I in order to understand Part II. Like the previous one it is the continuation of Javascript Series from Apna College. You can refer to the link below in order to learn. The notes and slides are provided inside YouTube description. For coding part you can refer to this repo. Codes are not exactly the same because I tried writing them by myself after understanding the concepts. However valuable comments are added in the code as notes in those part where the things are getting a bit complex.

It is advisied to follow up the video for better undersatnding of this part because you need to play a lot with browsers console. Don't use node js for running codes in this part. Use browsers console as much as you can and keep a follow up with the tutorial.
