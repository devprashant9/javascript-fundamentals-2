    // class is a program-code tempelate for creating objects

    // it is used to create objects of similar type which have some state(variables) and behaviours(methods)

    class Car {

      start() {
        console.log("Start");
      }

      stop() {
        console.log("Stop");
      }

      brand(brand) {
        this.brandName = brand;
        console.log(this.brandName);

        //"this" is being used so that we could set brand name for each individual object when they gets created

        //if you dont use "this" it will throw you error

        /* In most places you will find that 
            brand(brand) {
                this.brand = brand;
                console.log(this.brandName);
      }
                you notice that all variables are same but the argument passed as "brand" and the right side "brand" means the same.

                however "this.brand" is a different variable. it does not give error because it becomes local variable to that object which is being called because of this keyword

                you can use any name after "this" keyword

                this.brandName = brand
                this.name = brand
                thi.carBrand = brand
        
        
        */
      }
    }

    let fortuner = new Car();
    let thar = new Car();
    let benz = new Car();
    benz.brandName("Mercedes");

    // to use methods just write object name . method name (Do this in browsers terminal)

    //Eg: benz.start(), thar.stop(), fortuner.start(), fortuner.stop()
  </script>
</html>

<!-- 
  Run this in browsers console and type fortuner, it will print will Toyota {} object

  Now when you will see the prototype of toyota object you will notice that the "start () and stop ()", methods are also present

  Now if you log "fortuner.start()", it will print "Start"

  So the "fortuner object" has inherited all the methods of the "class Toyota". In order to use them you just need to call them

  So its providing code resuability

  you can create miltiple such objects and all of tjem will inherit the methods of class froom which the object is being created
