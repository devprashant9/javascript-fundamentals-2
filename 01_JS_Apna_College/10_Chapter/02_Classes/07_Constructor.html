<!-- 
        if you log any object in browsers console you will be able to see respective arguments as output

        constructor basically does the job which is needed during initialization

        we can also assign value to constructor later

        as you can see we are not passing argument in 3rd object. so it will show undefined. but we can simply do it by (benz.brand = 'mercedes') {try this in browsers console}

        we can even pass multiple parameters to constructor
