<!--        User Defined Prototype

    1.) Here the scenario is same but the thing is since "Prashant's" salary is little higher it comes under 20% tax slab

    2.) Now the catch is both "employee object" and "prashant object", have the same function name

    3.) which of them will be called??

    4.) If you go to browsers console and log "Prashant.calTax()", it will return you "The Tax rate is 20%"

    5.) take a note that it will not be overwriiten the prototype will still have the "calTax()" method of employee object. and Prashant will also have a "calTax ()" of its own. So both of them exists.

    6.) So we can conclude that priority is given to self method od the object if methods have same name
